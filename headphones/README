## **Technical Details**



### 1. **CSS Implementation**
   - The hover/active states for links and buttons are implemented with the following styles:
     ```css
     /* Links hover/active state */
     a:hover, a:active {
         color: #FF6565;
     }

     /* Buttons hover/active state */
     button:hover, button:active {
         opacity: 0.9;
     }
     ```

   - The maximum width of content is defined using the following rule:
     ```css
     /* Center content and set max width */
     .container {
         max-width: 1000px;
         margin: 0 auto;
     }
     ```

  @media (max-width: 480px) {
      /* Mobile-specific styles go here */
  }
